Once this process is complete, what is the result of multiplying the first two numbers in the list?\\n\\nYour puzzle answer was 40132.\\n\\n--- Part Two ---\\nThe logic you've constructed forms a single round of the Knot Hash algorithm; running the full thing requires many of these rounds. Some input and output processing is also required.\\n\\nFirst, from now on, your input should be taken not as a list of numbers, but as a string of bytes instead. Unless otherwise specified, convert characters to bytes using their ASCII codes. This will allow you to handle arbitrary ASCII strings, and it also ensures that your input lengths are never larger than 255. For example, if you are given 1,2,3, you should convert it to the ASCII codes for each character: 49,44,50,44,51.\\n\\nOnce you have determined the sequence of lengths to use, add the following lengths to the end of the sequence: 17, 31, 73, 47, 23. For example, if you are given 1,2,3, your final sequence of lengths should be 49,44,50,44,51,17,31,73,47,23 (the ASCII codes from the input string combined with the standard length suffix values).\\n\\nSecond, instead of merely running one round like you did above, run a total of 64 rounds, using the same length sequence in each round. The current position and skip size should be preserved between rounds. For example, if the previous example was your first round, you would start your second round with the same length sequence (3, 4, 1, 5, 17, 31, 73, 47, 23, now assuming they came from ASCII codes and include the suffix), but start with the previous round's current position (4) and skip size (4).\\n\\nOnce the rounds are complete, you will be left with the numbers from 0 to 255 in some order, called the sparse hash. Your next task is to reduce these to a list of only 16 numbers called the dense hash. To do this, use numeric bitwise XOR to combine each consecutive block of 16 numbers in the sparse hash (there are 16 such blocks in a list of 256 numbers). So, the first element in the dense hash is the first sixteen elements of the sparse hash XOR'd together, the second element in the dense hash is the second sixteen elements of the sparse hash XOR'd together, etc.\\n\\nFor example, if the first sixteen elements of your sparse hash are as shown below, and the XOR operator is ^, you would calculate the first output number like this:\\n\\n65 ^ 27 ^ 9 ^ 1 ^ 4 ^ 3 ^ 40 ^ 50 ^ 91 ^ 7 ^ 6 ^ 0 ^ 2 ^ 5 ^ 68 ^ 22 = 64\\nPerform this operation on each of the sixteen blocks of sixteen numbers in your sparse hash to determine the sixteen numbers in your dense hash.\\n\\nFinally, the standard way to represent a Knot Hash is as a single hexadecimal string; the final output is the dense hash in hexadecimal notation. Because each number in your dense hash will be between 0 and 255 (inclusive), always represent each number as two hexadecimal digits (including a leading zero as necessary). So, if your first three numbers are 64, 7, 255, they correspond to the hexadecimal numbers 40, 07, ff, and so the first six characters of the hash would be 4007ff. Because every Knot Hash is sixteen such numbers, the hexadecimal representation is always 32 hexadecimal digits (0-f) long.\\n\\nHere are some example hashes:\\n\\nThe empty string becomes a2582a3a0e66e6e86e3812dcb672a272.\\nAoC 2017 becomes 33efeb34ea91902bb2f59c9920caa6cd.\\n1,2,3 becomes 3efbe78a8d82f29979031a4aa0b16a9d.\\n1,2,4 becomes 63960835bcdc130f0b66d7ff4f6a5a8e.\\nTreating your puzzle input as a string of ASCII characters, what is the Knot Hash of your puzzle input? Ignore any leading or trailing whitespace you might encounter.\\n"

Messages are passed between programs using these pipes, but most programs aren't connected to each other directly. Instead, programs pass messages between each other until the message reaches the intended recipient.\\n\\nFor some reason, though, some of these messages aren't ever reaching their intended recipient, and the programs suspect that some pipes are missing. They would like you to investigate.\\n\\nYou walk through the village and record the ID of each program and the IDs with which it can communicate directly (your puzzle input). Each program has one or more programs with which it can communicate, and these pipes are bidirectional; if 8 says it can communicate with 11, then 11 will say it can communicate with 8.\\n\\nYou need to figure out how many programs are in the group that contains program ID 0.\\n\\nFor example, suppose you go door-to-door like a travelling salesman and record the following list:\\n\\n0 <-> 2\\n1 <-> 1\\n2 <-> 0, 3, 4\\n3 <-> 2, 4\\n4 <-> 2, 3, 6\\n5 <-> 6\\n6 <-> 4, 5\\nIn this example, the following programs are in the group that contains program ID 0:\\n\\nProgram 0 by definition.\\nProgram 2, directly connected to program 0.\\nProgram 3 via program 2.\\nProgram 4 via program 2.\\nProgram 5 via programs 6, then 4, then 2.\\nProgram 6 via programs 4, then 2.\\nTherefore, a total of 6 programs are in this group; all but program 1, which has a pipe that connects it to itself.\\n\\nHow many programs are in the group that contains program ID 0?\\n\\nYour puzzle answer was 128.\\n\\n--- Part Two ---\\nThere are more programs than just the ones in the group containing program ID 0. The rest of them have no way of reaching that group, and still might have no way of reaching each other.\\n\\nA group is a collection of programs that can all communicate via pipes either directly or indirectly. The programs you identified just a moment ago are all part of the same group. Now, they would like you to determine the total number of groups.\\n\\nIn the example above, there were 2 groups: one consisting of programs 0,2,3,4,5,6, and the other consisting solely of program 1.\\n\\nHow many groups are there in total?\\n"

The firewall consists of several layers, each with a security scanner that moves back and forth across the layer. To succeed, you must not be detected by a scanner.\\n\\nBy studying the firewall briefly, you are able to record (in your puzzle input) the depth of each layer and the range of the scanning area for the scanner within it, written as depth: range.

You are not caught in layer 1, since the scanner moved into the top of the layer once you were already there.\\n\\nThe severity of getting caught on a layer is equal to its depth multiplied by its range. (Ignore layers in which you do not get caught.) The severity of the whole trip is the sum of these values. In the example above, the trip severity is 0*3 + 6*4 = 24.\\n\\nGiven the details of the firewall you've recorded, if you leave immediately, what is the severity of your whole trip?\\n\\nYour puzzle answer was 1960.\\n\\n--- Part Two ---\\nNow, you need to pass through the firewall without being caught - easier said than done.\\n\\nYou can't control the speed of the packet, but you can delay it any number of picoseconds. For each picosecond you delay the packet before beginning your trip, all security scanners move one step. You're not in the firewall during this time; you don't enter layer 0 until you stop delaying the packet.\\n\\nIn the example above, if you delay 10 picoseconds (picoseconds 0 - 9), you won't get caught:\\n\\nState after delaying:\\n 0   1   2   3   4   5   6\\n[ ] [S] ... ...

The generators, called generator A and generator B, are trying to agree on a sequence of numbers. However, one of them is malfunctioning, and so the sequences don't always match.\\n\\nAs they do this, a judge waits for each of them to generate its next value, compares the lowest 16 bits of both values, and keeps track of the number of times those parts of the values match.\\n\\nThe generators both work on the same principle. To create its next value, a generator will take the previous value it produced, multiply it by a factor (generator A uses 16807; generator B uses 48271), and then keep the remainder of dividing that resulting product by 2147483647. That final remainder is the value it produces next.\\n\\nTo calculate each generator's first value, it instead uses a specific starting value as its \"previous value\" (as listed in your puzzle input).\\n\\nFor example, suppose that for starting values, generator A uses 65, while generator B uses 8921. Then, the first five pairs of generated values are:\\n\\n--Gen. A--  --Gen. B--\\n   1092455   430625591\\n1181022009  1233683848\\n 245556042  1431495498\\n1744312007   137874439\\n1352636452   285222916\\nIn binary, these pairs are (with generator A's value first in each pair):\\n\\n00000000000100001010101101100111\\n00011001101010101101001100110111\\n\\n01000110011001001111011100111001\\n01001001100010001000010110001000\\n\\n00001110101000101110001101001010\\n01010101010100101110001101001010\\n\\n01100111111110000001011011000111\\n00001000001101111100110000000111\\n\\n01010000100111111001100000100100\\n00010001000000000010100000000100\\nHere, you can see that the lowest (here, rightmost) 16 bits of the third value match: 1110001101001010. Because of this one match, after processing these five pairs, the judge would have added only 1 to its total.\\n\\nTo get a significant sample, the judge would like to consider 40 million pairs.

The generators, called generator A and generator B, are trying to agree on a sequence of numbers. However, one of them is malfunctioning, and so the sequences don't always match.\\n\\nAs they do this, a judge waits for each of them to generate its next value, compares the lowest 16 bits of both values, and keeps track of the number of times those parts of the values match.\\n\\nThe generators both work on the same principle. To create its next value, a generator will take the previous value it produced, multiply it by a factor (generator A uses 16807; generator B uses 48271), and then keep the remainder of dividing that resulting product by 2147483647. That final remainder is the value it produces next.\\n\\nTo calculate each generator's first value, it instead uses a specific starting value as its \"previous value\" (as listed in your puzzle input).\\n\\nFor example, suppose that for starting values, generator A uses 65, while generator B uses 8921. Then, the first five pairs of generated values are:\\n\\n--Gen. A--  --Gen. B--\\n   1092455   430625591\\n1181022009  1233683848\\n 245556042  1431495498\\n1744312007   137874439\\n1352636452   285222916\\nIn binary, these pairs are (with generator A's value first in each pair):\\n\\n00000000000100001010101101100111\\n00011001101010101101001100110111\\n\\n01000110011001001111011100111001\\n01001001100010001000010110001000\\n\\n00001110101000101110001101001010\\n01010101010100101110001101001010\\n\\n01100111111110000001011011000111\\n00001000001101111100110000000111\\n\\n01010000100111111001100000100100\\n00010001000000000010100000000100\\nHere, you can see that the lowest (here, rightmost) 16 bits of the third value match: 1110001101001010. Because of this one match, after processing these five pairs, the judge would have added only 1 to its total.\\n\\nTo get a significant sample, the judge would like to consider 40 million pairs. (In the example above, the judge would eventually find a total of 588 pairs that match in their lowest 16 bits.)\\n\\nAfter 40 million pairs, what is the judge's final count?\\n\\nYour puzzle answer was 594.\\n\\n--- Part Two ---\\nIn the interest of trying to align a little better, the generators get more picky about the numbers they actually give to the judge.\\n\\nThey still generate values in the same way, but now they only hand a value to the judge when it meets their criteria:\\n\\nGenerator A looks for values that are multiples of 4.\\nGenerator B looks for values that are multiples of 8.\\nEach generator functions completely independently: they both go through values entirely on their own, only occasionally handing an acceptable value to the judge, and otherwise working through the same sequence of values as before until they find one.\\n\\nThe judge still waits for each generator to provide it with a value before comparing them (using the same comparison method as before). It keeps track of the order it receives values; the first values from each generator are compared, then the second values from each generator, then the third values, and so on.\\n\\nUsing the example starting values given above, the generators now produce the following first five values each:\\n\\n--Gen. A--  --Gen. B--\\n1352636452  1233683848\\n1992081072   862516352\\n 530830436  1159784568\\n1980017072  1616057672\\n 740335192   412269392\\nThese values have the following corresponding binary values:\\n\\n01010000100111111001100000100100\\n01001001100010001000010110001000\\n\\n01110110101111001011111010110000\\n00110011011010001111010010000000\\n\\n00011111101000111101010001100100\\n01000101001000001110100001111000\\n\\n01110110000001001010100110110000\\n01100000010100110001010101001000\\n\\n00101100001000001001111001011000\\n00011000100100101011101101010000\\nUnfortunately, even though this change makes more bits similar on average, none of these values' lowest 16 bits match. Now, it's not until the 1056th pair that the judge finds the first match:\\n\\n--Gen. A--  --Gen. B--\\n1023762912   896885216\\n\\n00111101000001010110000111100000\\n00110101011101010110000111100000\\nThis change makes the generators much slower, and the judge is getting impatient; it is now only willing to consider 5 million pairs. (Using the values from the example above, after five million pairs, the judge would eventually find a total of 309 pairs that match in their lowest 16 bits.)\\n\\nAfter 5 million pairs, but using this new generator logic, what is the judge's final count?\\n"

While you actually got most of the instructions correct, there are a few key differences. This assembly code isn't about sound at all - it's meant to be run twice at the same time.\\n\\nEach running copy of the program has its own set of registers and follows the code independently - in fact, the programs don't even necessarily run at the same speed. To coordinate, they use the send (snd) and receive (rcv) instructions:\\n\\nsnd X sends the value of X to the other program. These values wait in a queue until that program is ready to receive them. Each program has its own message queue, so a program can never receive a message it sent.\\nrcv X receives the next value and stores it in register X. If no values are in the queue, the program waits for a value to be sent to it. Programs do not continue to the next instruction until they have received a value. Values are received in the order they are sent.\\nEach program also has its own program ID (one 0 and the other 1); the register p should begin with this value.\\n\\nFor example:\\n\\nsnd 1\\nsnd 2\\nsnd p\\nrcv a\\nrcv b\\nrcv c\\nrcv d\\nBoth programs begin by sending three values to the other. Program 0 sends 1, 2, 0; program 1 sends 1, 2, 1. Then, each program receives a value (both 1) and stores it in a, receives another value (both 2) and stores it in b, and then each receives the program ID of the other program (program 0 receives 1; program 1 receives 0) and stores it in c. Each program now sees a different value in its own copy of register c.\\n\\nFinally, both programs try to rcv a fourth time, but no data is waiting for either of them, and they reach a deadlock. When this happens, both programs terminate.\\n\\nIt should be noted that it would be equally valid for the programs to run at different speeds; for example, program 0 might have sent all three values and then stopped at the first rcv before program 1 executed even its first instruction.\\n\\nOnce both of your programs have terminated (regardless of what caused them to do so), how many times did program 1 send a value?\\n"

So:\\n\\nClean nodes become weakened.\\nWeakened nodes become infected.\\nInfected nodes become flagged.\\nFlagged nodes become clean.\\nEvery node is always in exactly one of the above states.\\n\\nThe virus carrier still functions in a similar way, but now uses the following logic during its bursts of action:\\n\\nDecide which way to turn based on the current node:\\nIf it is clean, it turns left.\\nIf it is weakened, it does not turn, and will continue moving in the same direction.\\nIf it is infected, it turns right.\\nIf it is flagged, it reverses direction, and will go back the way it came.\\nModify the state of the current node, as described above.\\nThe virus carrier moves forward one node in the direction it is facing.\\nStart with the same map (still using . for clean and # for infected) and still with the virus carrier starting in the middle and facing up.\\n\\nUsing the same initial state as the previous example, and drawing weakened as W and flagged as F, the middle of the infinite grid looks like this, with the virus carrier's position again marked with [ ]:\\n\\n. . . . . . . . .\\n. . . . . . . . .\\n. . . . . . . . .\\n. . . . . # . . .\\n. . . #[.]. . . .\\n. . . . . . . . .\\n. . . . . . . . .\\n. . . . . . . . .\\nThis is the same as before, since no initial nodes are weakened or flagged.

Here, in the expansive central chamber, you find a grand apparatus that fills the entire room, suspended nanometers above your head.\\n\\nYou had always imagined CPUs to be noisy, chaotic places, bustling with activity. Instead, the room is quiet, motionless, and dark.\\n\\nSuddenly, you and the CPU's garbage collector startle each other. \"It's not often we get many visitors here!\", he says. You inquire about the stopped machinery.\\n\\n\"It stopped milliseconds ago; not sure why. I'm a garbage collector, not a doctor.\" You ask what the machine is for.\\n\\n\"Programs these days, don't know their origins. That's the Turing machine! It's what makes the whole computer work.\" You try to explain that Turing machines are merely models of computation, but he cuts you off. \"No, see, that's just what they want you to think. Ultimately, inside every CPU, there's a Turing machine driving the whole thing! Too bad this one's broken. We're doomed!\"\\n\\nYou ask how you can help. \"Well, unfortunately, the only way to get the computer running again would be to create a whole new Turing machine from scratch, but there's no way you can-\" He notices the look on your face, gives you a curious glance, shrugs, and goes back to sweeping the floor.\\n\\nYou find the Turing machine blueprints (your puzzle input) on a tablet in a nearby pile of debris. Looking back up at the broken Turing machine above, you can start to identify its parts:\\n\\nA tape which contains 0 repeated infinitely to the left and right.\\nA cursor, which can move left or right along the tape and read or write values at its current position.\\nA set of states, each containing rules about what to do based on the current value under the cursor.\\nEach slot on the tape has two possible values: 0 (the starting value for all slots) and 1. Based on whether the cursor is pointing at a 0 or a 1, the current state says what value to write at the current position of the cursor, whether to move the cursor left or right one slot, and which state to use next.\\n\\nFor example, suppose you found the following blueprint:\\n\\nBegin in state A.\\nPerform a diagnostic checksum after 6 steps.\\n\\nIn state A:\\n  If the current value is 0:\\n    - Write the value 1.\\n    - Move one slot to the right.\\n    - Continue with state B.\\n  If the current value is 1:\\n    - Write the value 0.\\n    - Move one slot to the left.\\n    - Continue with state B.\\n\\nIn state B:\\n  If the current value is 0:\\n    - Write the value 1.\\n    - Move one slot to the left.\\n    - Continue with state A.\\n  If the current value is 1:\\n    - Write the value 1.\\n    - Move one slot to the right.\\n    - Continue with state A.\\nRunning it until the number of steps required to take the listed diagnostic checksum would result in the following tape configurations (with the cursor marked in square brackets):\\n\\n... 0  0  0 [0] 0  0 ... (before any steps; about to run state A)\\n... 0  0  0  1 [0] 0 ... (after 1 step;     about to run state B)\\n... 0  0  0 [1] 1  0 ... (after 2 steps;    about to run state A)\\n... 0  0 [0] 0  1  0 ... (after 3 steps;    about to run state B)\\n... 0 [0] 1  0  1  0 ... (after 4 steps;    about to run state A)\\n... 0  1 [1] 0  1  0 ... (after 5 steps;    about to run state B)\\n... 0  1  1 [0] 1  0 ... (after 6 steps;    about to run state A)\\nThe CPU can confirm that the Turing machine is working by taking a diagnostic checksum after a specific number of steps (given in the blueprint). Once the specified number of steps have been executed, the Turing machine should pause; once it does, count the number of times 1 appears on the tape. In the above example, the diagnostic checksum is 3.\\n\\nRecreate the Turing machine and save the computer! What is the diagnostic checksum it produces once it's working again?\\n"
