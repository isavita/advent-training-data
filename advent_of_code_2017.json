The skip size increases to 4.\nIn this example, the first two numbers in the list end up being 3 and 4; to check the process, you can multiply them together to produce 12.\n\nHowever, you should instead use the standard list size of 256 (with values 0 to 255) and the sequence of lengths in your puzzle input.

Once this process is complete, what is the result of multiplying the first two numbers in the list?\n\nYour puzzle answer was 40132.\n\n--- Part Two ---\nThe logic you've constructed forms a single round of the Knot Hash algorithm; running the full thing requires many of these rounds. Some input and output processing is also required.\n\nFirst, from now on, your input should be taken not as a list of numbers, but as a string of bytes instead. Unless otherwise specified, convert characters to bytes using their ASCII codes. This will allow you to handle arbitrary ASCII strings, and it also ensures that your input lengths are never larger than 255. For example, if you are given 1,2,3, you should convert it to the ASCII codes for each character: 49,44,50,44,51.\n\nOnce you have determined the sequence of lengths to use, add the following lengths to the end of the sequence: 17, 31, 73, 47, 23. For example, if you are given 1,2,3, your final sequence of lengths should be 49,44,50,44,51,17,31,73,47,23 (the ASCII codes from the input string combined with the standard length suffix values).\n\nSecond, instead of merely running one round like you did above, run a total of 64 rounds, using the same length sequence in each round. The current position and skip size should be preserved between rounds. For example, if the previous example was your first round, you would start your second round with the same length sequence (3, 4, 1, 5, 17, 31, 73, 47, 23, now assuming they came from ASCII codes and include the suffix), but start with the previous round's current position (4) and skip size (4).\n\nOnce the rounds are complete, you will be left with the numbers from 0 to 255 in some order, called the sparse hash. Your next task is to reduce these to a list of only 16 numbers called the dense hash. To do this, use numeric bitwise XOR to combine each consecutive block of 16 numbers in the sparse hash (there are 16 such blocks in a list of 256 numbers). So, the first element in the dense hash is the first sixteen elements of the sparse hash XOR'd together, the second element in the dense hash is the second sixteen elements of the sparse hash XOR'd together, etc.\n\nFor example, if the first sixteen elements of your sparse hash are as shown below, and the XOR operator is ^, you would calculate the first output number like this:\n\n65 ^ 27 ^ 9 ^ 1 ^ 4 ^ 3 ^ 40 ^ 50 ^ 91 ^ 7 ^ 6 ^ 0 ^ 2 ^ 5 ^ 68 ^ 22 = 64\nPerform this operation on each of the sixteen blocks of sixteen numbers in your sparse hash to determine the sixteen numbers in your dense hash.\n\nFinally, the standard way to represent a Knot Hash is as a single hexadecimal string; the final output is the dense hash in hexadecimal notation. Because each number in your dense hash will be between 0 and 255 (inclusive), always represent each number as two hexadecimal digits (including a leading zero as necessary). So, if your first three numbers are 64, 7, 255, they correspond to the hexadecimal numbers 40, 07, ff, and so the first six characters of the hash would be 4007ff. Because every Knot Hash is sixteen such numbers, the hexadecimal representation is always 32 hexadecimal digits (0-f) long.\n\nHere are some example hashes:\n\nThe empty string becomes a2582a3a0e66e6e86e3812dcb672a272.\nAoC 2017 becomes 33efeb34ea91902bb2f59c9920caa6cd.\n1,2,3 becomes 3efbe78a8d82f29979031a4aa0b16a9d.\n1,2,4 becomes 63960835bcdc130f0b66d7ff4f6a5a8e.\nTreating your puzzle input as a string of ASCII characters, what is the Knot Hash of your puzzle input? Ignore any leading or trailing whitespace you might encounter.\n"

Messages are passed between programs using these pipes, but most programs aren't connected to each other directly. Instead, programs pass messages between each other until the message reaches the intended recipient.\n\nFor some reason, though, some of these messages aren't ever reaching their intended recipient, and the programs suspect that some pipes are missing. They would like you to investigate.\n\nYou walk through the village and record the ID of each program and the IDs with which it can communicate directly (your puzzle input). Each program has one or more programs with which it can communicate, and these pipes are bidirectional; if 8 says it can communicate with 11, then 11 will say it can communicate with 8.\n\nYou need to figure out how many programs are in the group that contains program ID 0.\n\nFor example, suppose you go door-to-door like a travelling salesman and record the following list:\n\n0 <-> 2\n1 <-> 1\n2 <-> 0, 3, 4\n3 <-> 2, 4\n4 <-> 2, 3, 6\n5 <-> 6\n6 <-> 4, 5\nIn this example, the following programs are in the group that contains program ID 0:\n\nProgram 0 by definition.\nProgram 2, directly connected to program 0.\nProgram 3 via program 2.\nProgram 4 via program 2.\nProgram 5 via programs 6, then 4, then 2.\nProgram 6 via programs 4, then 2.\nTherefore, a total of 6 programs are in this group; all but program 1, which has a pipe that connects it to itself.\n\nHow many programs are in the group that contains program ID 0?\n\nYour puzzle answer was 128.\n\n--- Part Two ---\nThere are more programs than just the ones in the group containing program ID 0. The rest of them have no way of reaching that group, and still might have no way of reaching each other.\n\nA group is a collection of programs that can all communicate via pipes either directly or indirectly. The programs you identified just a moment ago are all part of the same group. Now, they would like you to determine the total number of groups.\n\nIn the example above, there were 2 groups: one consisting of programs 0,2,3,4,5,6, and the other consisting solely of program 1.\n\nHow many groups are there in total?\n"

The firewall consists of several layers, each with a security scanner that moves back and forth across the layer. To succeed, you must not be detected by a scanner.\n\nBy studying the firewall briefly, you are able to record (in your puzzle input) the depth of each layer and the range of the scanning area for the scanner within it, written as depth: range. Each layer has a thickness of exactly 1. A layer at depth 0 begins immediately inside the firewall; a layer at depth 1 would start immediately after that.\n\nFor example, suppose you've recorded the following:\n\n0: 3\n1: 2\n4: 4\n6: 4\nThis means that there is a layer immediately inside the firewall (with range 3), a second layer immediately after that (with range 2), a third layer which begins at depth 4 (with range 4), and a fourth layer which begins at depth 6 (also with range 4).

Each picosecond, the packet moves one layer forward (its first move takes it into layer 0), and then the scanners move one step. If there is a scanner at the top of the layer as your packet enters it, you are caught.

You are not caught in layer 1, since the scanner moved into the top of the layer once you were already there.\n\nThe severity of getting caught on a layer is equal to its depth multiplied by its range. (Ignore layers in which you do not get caught.) The severity of the whole trip is the sum of these values. In the example above, the trip severity is 0*3 + 6*4 = 24.\n\nGiven the details of the firewall you've recorded, if you leave immediately, what is the severity of your whole trip?\n\nYour puzzle answer was 1960.\n\n--- Part Two ---\nNow, you need to pass through the firewall without being caught - easier said than done.\n\nYou can't control the speed of the packet, but you can delay it any number of picoseconds. For each picosecond you delay the packet before beginning your trip, all security scanners move one step. You're not in the firewall during this time; you don't enter layer 0 until you stop delaying the packet.\n\nIn the example above, if you delay 10 picoseconds (picoseconds 0 - 9), you won't get caught:\n\nState after delaying:\n 0   1   2   3   4   5   6\n[ ] [S] ... ...

The generators, called generator A and generator B, are trying to agree on a sequence of numbers. However, one of them is malfunctioning, and so the sequences don't always match.\n\nAs they do this, a judge waits for each of them to generate its next value, compares the lowest 16 bits of both values, and keeps track of the number of times those parts of the values match.\n\nThe generators both work on the same principle. To create its next value, a generator will take the previous value it produced, multiply it by a factor (generator A uses 16807; generator B uses 48271), and then keep the remainder of dividing that resulting product by 2147483647.

The generators, called generator A and generator B, are trying to agree on a sequence of numbers. However, one of them is malfunctioning, and so the sequences don't always match.\n\nAs they do this, a judge waits for each of them to generate its next value, compares the lowest 16 bits of both values, and keeps track of the number of times those parts of the values match.\n\nThe generators both work on the same principle. To create its next value, a generator will take the previous value it produced, multiply it by a factor (generator A uses 16807; generator B uses 48271), and then keep the remainder of dividing that resulting product by 2147483647. That final remainder is the value it produces next.\n\nTo calculate each generator's first value, it instead uses a specific starting value as its \"previous value\" (as listed in your puzzle input).\n\nFor example, suppose that for starting values, generator A uses 65, while generator B uses 8921. Then, the first five pairs of generated values are:\n\n--Gen. A--  --Gen. B--\n   1092455   430625591\n1181022009  1233683848\n 245556042  1431495498\n1744312007   137874439\n1352636452   285222916\nIn binary, these pairs are (with generator A's value first in each pair):\n\n00000000000100001010101101100111\n00011001101010101101001100110111\n\n01000110011001001111011100111001\n01001001100010001000010110001000\n\n00001110101000101110001101001010\n01010101010100101110001101001010\n\n01100111111110000001011011000111\n00001000001101111100110000000111\n\n01010000100111111001100000100100\n00010001000000000010100000000100\nHere, you can see that the lowest (here, rightmost) 16 bits of the third value match: 1110001101001010. Because of this one match, after processing these five pairs, the judge would have added only 1 to its total.\n\nTo get a significant sample, the judge would like to consider 40 million pairs. (In the example above, the judge would eventually find a total of 588 pairs that match in their lowest 16 bits.)\n\nAfter 40 million pairs, what is the judge's final count?\n\nYour puzzle answer was 594.\n\n--- Part Two ---\nIn the interest of trying to align a little better, the generators get more picky about the numbers they actually give to the judge.\n\nThey still generate values in the same way, but now they only hand a value to the judge when it meets their criteria:\n\nGenerator A looks for values that are multiples of 4.\nGenerator B looks for values that are multiples of 8.\nEach generator functions completely independently: they both go through values entirely on their own, only occasionally handing an acceptable value to the judge, and otherwise working through the same sequence of values as before until they find one.\n\nThe judge still waits for each generator to provide it with a value before comparing them (using the same comparison method as before). It keeps track of the order it receives values; the first values from each generator are compared, then the second values from each generator, then the third values, and so on.\n\nUsing the example starting values given above, the generators now produce the following first five values each:\n\n--Gen. A--  --Gen. B--\n1352636452  1233683848\n1992081072   862516352\n 530830436  1159784568\n1980017072  1616057672\n 740335192   412269392\nThese values have the following corresponding binary values:\n\n01010000100111111001100000100100\n01001001100010001000010110001000\n\n01110110101111001011111010110000\n00110011011010001111010010000000\n\n00011111101000111101010001100100\n01000101001000001110100001111000\n\n01110110000001001010100110110000\n01100000010100110001010101001000\n\n00101100001000001001111001011000\n00011000100100101011101101010000\nUnfortunately, even though this change makes more bits similar on average, none of these values' lowest 16 bits match. Now, it's not until the 1056th pair that the judge finds the first match:\n\n--Gen. A--  --Gen. B--\n1023762912   896885216\n\n00111101000001010110000111100000\n00110101011101010110000111100000\nThis change makes the generators much slower, and the judge is getting impatient; it is now only willing to consider 5 million pairs. (Using the values from the example above, after five million pairs, the judge would eventually find a total of 309 pairs that match in their lowest 16 bits.)\n\nAfter 5 million pairs, but using this new generator logic, what is the judge's final count?\n"
